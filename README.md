DIrrlicht - D Bindings for Irrlicht Engine
==========================================

Details
-------

DIrrlicht is the D Bindings for Irrlicht Engine which makes it possible to use Irrlicht Engine from D. It copies the API of Irrlicht Engine, but in a way that makes sense in D.

Installation
------------

DIrrlicht relies on CIrrlicht, so you have to install CIrrlicht in order to compile DIrrlicht. On Linux, currently the Code::Blocks is supported. It assumes that Irrlicht and CIrrlicht are installed in "$HOME" directory, so you have to place them in that directory and then open the Code::Blocks project and compile. At later time, building with dub will also be supported.

License
-------

It is released under permissive zlib license same as Irrlicht Engine.
